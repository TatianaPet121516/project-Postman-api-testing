# ðŸš€ Automation Exercise API - Postman Test Collection

![Postman Collection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-Collection-orange?logo=postman) ![Newman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Newman-CLI-blue?logo=javascript) ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-v20.12.2-green?logo=node.js)  
This repository contains a collection of Postman API tests for the [Automation Exercise API](https://www.automationexercise.com/api_list). The tests cover various API endpoints, ensuring that all functionalities work as expected.

You can run the tests locally using Newman, the command-line companion for Postman, and integrate it into your development environment using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
